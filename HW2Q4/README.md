# This is a python script of HW2 Question 4.  
  
The encryption and decryption functions are in the `2023HW2.py`.  
There is also a main function in the same file.  
  
`ouput.txt` is the output file.  
The output can be obtained by executing the script (cmd: `python3 2023HW2.py`).   
  
I define the key and the input plaintext at the beginning of the main function.  
You can change the key and the input plaintext.
