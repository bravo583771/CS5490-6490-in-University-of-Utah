TCP: server open ---> connect with client ---> client sends message to server 
            ---> server receives and sends back another messages 
            ---> client receives and close (send close to server)
            ---> server close.
Create server (Bob) with g= 1907, p= 784313, SB= 12077.
Create client (Alice) with g= 1907, p= 784313, SA= 160031.

Client sends TA = g^SA mod p = 179464
Server receives TA = 179464
TA ^ SB mod p = 475269 which is equal to g^SASB mod p.

Server sends TB = g^SB mod p = 449485
Client receives TA = 449485
TB ^ SA mod p = 475269 which is equal to g^SASB mod p.
close server.
